# RecipeBook

RecipeBook is a community-driven recipe sharing platform built with React and Vite. Users can browse recipes, add new recipes, and leave comments and ratings. The application allows users to search for recipes by ingredients or cuisine and filter results based on dietary preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.

3. Start the JSON server by running the following command:

```sh
npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json
```

This command starts a JSON server on port 3500 and watches the `db.json` file in the `data` directory for changes.

4. Open a new terminal window or tab.

5. Again, navigate to the project directory.

6. Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    Remember, you need to keep both the JSON server and the development server running simultaneously for the application to work correctly.
